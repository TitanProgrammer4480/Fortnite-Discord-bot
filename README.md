# Fortnite-Discord-bot
=======================

# Generall Info
This bot was programmed with python. The main libraries are pycord and an api-wrapper for the fortnite api. From pycord I'm using just the shlash command feature.

# Commands
- /player player_name: You type the player name in and the bot returns an embed with the generall info, like the overall kills, deaths and the overall kd.
- /map: The bot returns an embed with an image of the current map.
- /pois: You get every poi fron the current map.
- /news1: You receive short news about updates and new items in Fortnite.
- /news2: The bot sends an embed for every article which he getsfrom the api. Th embed contains an image and the text.

# host the bot locally
First of all you nedd the code, you either copy the code from main.py and switch out the bot-token and the api-token into your own.
Or you can run a command to copy the entire repositorie.
The command:
```
Test
```
Then you need to install the dependencies. The programming language python and the libraries which stand in requirement.txt.
